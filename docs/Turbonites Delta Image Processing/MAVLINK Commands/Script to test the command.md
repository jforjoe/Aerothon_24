To control the speed of the drone using RC (radio control) commands through MAVLink, you can send **RC override commands**. This allows you to simulate RC input directly from the script, controlling throttle, pitch, roll, and yaw.

Here's how to do it with `pymavlink`:

### 1. Setting Up the RC Override Command
In MAVLink, RC override commands let you control the channels directly. These channels are usually mapped as follows (but they can vary by setup):

- Channel 1: Roll (AILERON)
- Channel 2: Pitch (ELEVATOR)
- Channel 3: Throttle
- Channel 4: Yaw (RUDDER)

For example, setting throttle can control the drone's vertical speed.

### 2. Writing the Script
Here’s a script to control the throttle channel (and optionally other channels) to test the drone’s speed. The throttle values are typically in the range **1100 to 1900**, where **1500** is neutral.

```python
from pymavlink import mavutil
import time

# Connect to the MAVProxy session
connection_string = 'udp:localhost:14551'
drone = mavutil.mavlink_connection(connection_string)

# Wait for a heartbeat before starting to send commands
drone.wait_heartbeat()
print("Heartbeat received. Connection established.")

# Function to send RC override command
def send_rc_override(roll=None, pitch=None, throttle=None, yaw=None):
    # Define a list for the 8 RC channels, setting None channels to 0
    rc_channels = [roll or 0, pitch or 0, throttle or 0, yaw or 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    drone.mav.rc_channels_override_send(
        drone.target_system,  # target_system
        drone.target_component,  # target_component
        *rc_channels
    )

# Arm the drone
def arm_drone():
    print("Arming the drone...")
    drone.mav.command_long_send(
        drone.target_system,
        drone.target_component,
        mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_COMPONENT_ARM_DISARM,
        0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    )
    drone.motors_armed_wait()
    print("Drone armed.")

# Disarm the drone
def disarm_drone():
    print("Disarming the drone...")
    drone.mav.command_long_send(
        drone.target_system,
        drone.target_component,
        mavutil.mavlink.MAV_CMD_COMPONENT_ARM_DISARM,
        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0
    )
    drone.motors_disarmed_wait()
    print("Drone disarmed.")

# Test RC override to control throttle
def test_throttle_control():
    try:
        # Arm the drone
        arm_drone()

        # Gradually increase throttle to test speed control
        print("Increasing throttle...")
        for throttle in range(1300, 1700, 50):
            print(f"Setting throttle to {throttle}")
            send_rc_override(throttle=throttle)
            time.sleep(2)  # Hold for 2 seconds to observe the effect

        # Gradually decrease throttle to land
        print("Decreasing throttle...")
        for throttle in range(1700, 1300, -50):
            print(f"Setting throttle to {throttle}")
            send_rc_override(throttle=throttle)
            time.sleep(2)  # Hold for 2 seconds to observe the effect

        # Set throttle to neutral and disarm
        send_rc_override(throttle=1500)  # Neutral position
        disarm_drone()

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # If interrupted, disarm the drone
        print("Interrupted! Disarming the drone...")
        disarm_drone()

# Run the test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_throttle_control()
```

### Explanation of the Script

1. **send_rc_override**: Sends RC override commands to control the drone’s roll, pitch, throttle, and yaw. You only need to set the throttle for speed testing.
  
2. **Throttle Control**: The `test_throttle_control` function gradually increases the throttle, waits to observe speed changes, and then decreases the throttle.

3. **Safety**: The script disarms the drone after testing. Always set throttle to a neutral position (1500) before disarming to avoid sudden drops.
