***Definition***: 
The automated communication process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring, display, and recording. It’s widely used in fields such as *aerospace, robotics, meteorology, agriculture, and drone technology*. In UAVs, for example, telemetry is crucial for providing real-time feedback on parameters like GPS position, altitude, airspeed, and battery levels, which can be essential for both autonomous operation and remote pilot decision-making.


### Telemetry System Components
A typical telemetry system includes the following components:

1. **Sensor Suite:** Collects data related to environmental conditions, equipment status, or other measurable factors.
2. **Data Acquisition Module:** Converts sensor outputs into a form suitable for transmission.
3. **Transmitter and Receiver:** Transmits the data to a ground station or another monitoring location. In a two-way telemetry system, it may also receive commands or adjustments.
4. **Ground Station:** Processes and displays data, allowing an operator to monitor, log, or control the system.

### 915 MHz 100 mW Telemetry in UAVs
In UAV applications, 915 MHz telemetry systems with a 100 mW output power level are ideal for medium- to long-range communications between the UAV and the ground control station. A setup might include:

1. **Transmitter on the UAV:** Sends telemetry data (e.g., GPS, altitude, attitude) to the ground station. It may also receive control inputs if the system supports two-way communication.
2. **Receiver at the Ground Station:** Often equipped with a high-gain antenna to extend range and reliability.
3. **Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS):** Many systems in this band use FHSS to reduce interference, hopping between different frequencies to avoid jamming and interference from other devices.

### 915 MHz Frequency Band
The 915 MHz frequency is part of the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) radio band, which is open for unlicensed use in many regions. Specifically, the 902–928 MHz range is allowed for ISM applications in the Americas, making it ideal for use in UAV telemetry, where high power levels are allowed under certain regulations.

The 915 MHz band is widely favored in telemetry applications for several reasons:

1. **Range and Penetration:** Lower frequencies like 915 MHz penetrate obstacles (e.g., trees and buildings) better than higher frequencies, such as the 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz bands, commonly used for other communications.
2. **Interference Management:** The 915 MHz band typically experiences less interference than the 2.4 GHz band, where many consumer devices operate (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). This results in a more reliable communication link in crowded RF environments.
3. **Data Rate and Latency:** While the 915 MHz band generally has a lower data rate compared to higher frequencies, it is typically sufficient for telemetry needs, where bandwidth requirements are modest.

### 100 mW Telemetry Power Output
The 100 mW power output is a moderate transmission power level commonly used in telemetry systems, especially for short- to medium-range applications.

- **Transmission Power and Range:** Higher transmission power (e.g., 100 mW) generally results in a longer communication range and can improve the reliability of the data link. For instance, a 100 mW transmitter at 915 MHz can provide a range of a few kilometers with line-of-sight (LOS) conditions.
  
- **Power Limitations and Regulations:** In many countries, 100 mW is within the legal power output limit for unlicensed devices in the ISM band. This balance between range and legal limitations makes it a practical choice for UAVs and remote sensing applications.

- **Impact on Battery Life:** A higher power output like 100 mW uses more energy, which is a crucial consideration in battery-operated devices like UAVs. Systems are designed to optimize transmission power dynamically based on distance to minimize battery usage.


### Practical Considerations and Challenges
1. **Line-of-Sight Requirement:** While 915 MHz provides good penetration, it still works best with a clear line of sight. Flying over hills, behind trees, or buildings can degrade signal strength.
2. **Antenna Placement and Design:** Proper antenna placement on both the UAV and the ground station maximizes the communication range and minimizes signal loss.
3. **Latency and Data Rate Limits:** Though typically acceptable for telemetry, applications requiring real-time high-bandwidth data streaming (e.g., video) would require other solutions, like a 2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz link for video feeds, with 915 MHz reserved for telemetry.
