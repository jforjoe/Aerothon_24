To calculate the field of view (FoV) for a specific resolution, like 640x480 pixels, on a camera module such as the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, we need to consider the sensor’s native resolution and its FoV, then scale it down to the lower resolution.

Here’s the process in steps:

### Given Information

- **Native Resolution**: 4608 x 2592 pixels (12 MP) for the IMX708 sensor.
- **Diagonal Field of View (FoV)**: 75 degrees at native resolution.
- **Target Resolution**: 640 x 480 pixels.

### Step 1: Calculate the Aspect Ratio and Diagonal Length at Native Resolution

The aspect ratio for the native resolution (4608 x 2592) is:

$$
\text{Aspect Ratio} = \frac{4608}{2592} = 1.777 \approx 16:9
$$

The diagonal resolution in pixels (based on Pythagoras' theorem for the right triangle) is:

$$
\text{Diagonal}_{\text{native}} = \sqrt{4608^2 + 2592^2} = \sqrt{21233664 + 6718464} = \sqrt{27952128} \approx 5288.79 \text{ pixels}
$$

### Step 2: Determine the Pixel Density for the Native FoV

Since the diagonal FoV is 75 degrees at this native diagonal resolution, we can calculate the **FoV per pixel** by dividing the diagonal FoV by the native diagonal pixel length:

$$
\text{FoV per Pixel} = \frac{75}{5288.79} \approx 0.01419 \text{ degrees per pixel}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the Diagonal Resolution for 640x480

Now, find the diagonal resolution for the target resolution of 640x480 pixels:

$$
\text{Diagonal}_{\text{target}} = \sqrt{640^2 + 480^2} = \sqrt{409600 + 230400} = \sqrt{640000} = 800 \text{ pixels}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the Effective FoV at 640x480

Now, use the FoV per pixel to find the diagonal FoV for the 640x480 resolution:

$$
\text{FoV}_{\text{640x480}} = 0.01419 \times 800 \approx 11.35 \text{ degrees}
$$

### Result

At a resolution of 640x480 pixels, the effective diagonal field of view of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 will be approximately **11.35 degrees**. This significant reduction in FoV occurs because we're using a much smaller section of the sensor’s full resolution, effectively cropping into the center of the sensor’s view.

# > Calculating Resolution based on the required FoV

If you want to achieve a field of view (FoV) of exactly **12 degrees** using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, we can calculate the required resolution (diagonal pixels) based on the FoV per pixel, as derived from the camera's native specifications.

### Given Information

- **Native Resolution**: 4608 x 2592 pixels (12 MP) for the IMX708 sensor.
- **Native Diagonal FoV**: 75 degrees.
- **Required Diagonal FoV**: 12 degrees.

### Step 1: Calculate the FoV per Pixel (from Native Resolution)

Using the previously calculated FoV per pixel:

$$
\text{FoV per Pixel} = \frac{75}{5288.79} \approx 0.01419 \text{ degrees per pixel}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate Required Diagonal Resolution for 12-Degree FoV

To find the number of pixels that would cover a 12-degree FoV, divide the target FoV by the FoV per pixel:

$$
\text{Required Diagonal Pixels} = \frac{12}{0.01419} \approx 845.86 \text{ pixels}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate Approximate Resolution (Width x Height) for 12-Degree FoV

Since the sensor’s aspect ratio is roughly **16:9** (from the native resolution), we can split the diagonal into width and height based on this ratio.

Let \( W \) and \( H \) be the width and height in pixels, respectively:

1. **Aspect Ratio Relation**: 
$$
\frac{W}{H} = \frac{16}{9}
$$

2. **Diagonal Relation**: 
$$
\sqrt{W^2 + H^2} \approx 845.86
$$

Using these two equations:

1. Substitute \( H = \frac{9}{16}W \) in the diagonal formula:
$$
\sqrt{W^2 + \left(\frac{9}{16}W\right)^2} \approx 845.86
$$

2. Simplify and solve for \( W \):
$$
\sqrt{W^2 + \frac{81}{256}W^2} = 845.86
$$
$$
W \sqrt{1 + \frac{81}{256}} \approx 845.86
$$
$$
W \times 1.175 \approx 845.86
$$
$$
W \approx \frac{845.86}{1.175} \approx 720 \text{ pixels}
$$

3. Calculate \( H \):
$$
H = \frac{9}{16} \times 720 \approx 405 \text{ pixels}
$$

### Result

To achieve a **12-degree FoV**, you should use a resolution of approximately **720 x 405 pixels** on the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3. This resolution will give you an effective diagonal FoV close to the desired 12 degrees.
