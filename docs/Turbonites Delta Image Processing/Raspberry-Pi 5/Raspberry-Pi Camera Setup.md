### 1. **Install Required Libraries**
First, ensure that **Picamera2** and the required dependencies are installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 python3-opencv libcamera-apps
```

### 2. **Python Script for Continuous Streaming with Picamera2**

Once you have **Picamera2** installed, you can use the following script for continuous video streaming:

```python
import cv2
from picamera2 import Picamera2

# Initialize the camera
picam2 = Picamera2()
picam2.preview_configuration.main.size = (640, 480)
picam2.preview_configuration.main.format = "RGB888"
picam2.preview_configuration.controls.FrameRate = 30
picam2.configure("preview")

# Start the camera
picam2.start()

# Stream video until 'q' is pressed
try:
    while True:
        # Capture the image from the camera
        frame = picam2.capture_array()

        # Display the frame using OpenCV
        cv2.imshow("Raspberry Pi Camera", frame)

        # Break the loop if 'q' is pressed
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Streaming stopped manually.")

finally:
    # Stop the camera and close windows
    picam2.stop()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    print("Video stream ended.")
```

### 3. **How the Script Works:**
- **Picamera2** is used to capture frames from the Raspberry Pi camera continuously.
- The captured frames are displayed in a window using **OpenCV**.
- The stream runs until you press **'q'** in the window or interrupt the script with `Ctrl+C`.

### 4. **Run the Script:**
1. Save the script as `stream_camera_picamera2.py`.
2. Run it with:

   ```bash
   python3 stream_camera_picamera2.py
   ```

You should see a live video stream, and you can stop the streaming by pressing **'q'** in the video window.

### Notes:
- **Picamera2** is designed to work with newer Raspberry Pi OS versions that use **libcamera**.
- If you're not seeing anything, make sure the camera is enabled and connected properly.
  
### Troubleshooting:
If you run into any issues, make sure that:
1. The camera is enabled via `raspi-config` under **Interface Options > Camera**.
2. The **Picamera2** and dependencies are installed correctly.
3. You have rebooted the Raspberry Pi after making camera-related changes.
